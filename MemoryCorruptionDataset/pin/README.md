To use pin tool first download from https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/pin-a-binary-instrumentation-tool-downloads.html

Then copy myPinTool.cpp, makefile and makefile.rules into $PIN_HOME/source/tools/MyPinTool/ and make the tool. If on 64-bit architecture this is achieved using:
 
     'make all TARGET=intel64'
     
The pin tool can then be run using:
    
     '$PIN_HOME/pin -t $PIN_HOME/source/tools/MyPinTool/obj-intel64/myPinTool.so -o outfile -- /usr/bin/bc'


pinScript.py was a script created to automatically do this over many binaries.
