This is the home of the NLP, preprocessing and deep learning.

All deep learning is done within neural_net.py. Instructions to use this are below.

FextractorPreprocessor.py contains all preprocessing necessary. Make sure this (and VDataset.py) are in the same folder neural_net.py when running as neural_net.py will use the other files for preprocessing.
